# The client data layer

`@azohra/meteo/station/client`: the framework-free polling loop and station
stores every binding rides — the mirror of `@azohra/meteo/station/server`,
one subpath per side of the wire. The react hooks are thin wrappers over
this layer; a binding for any other framework (or none) subscribes to the
same stores, so no binding can drift on cadence, parsing, merging, or
degradation. Importing the subpath is safe anywhere (SSR passes, node
tests); its loops only ever *run* against a live `fetch`.

## The mount base

Every entry point takes the **mount base** — where
`createStationFeedHandler` is mounted, e.g. `"/api/wind"` — and builds its
own route from it, mirroring the handler's pathname-suffix routing.
`feedEndpoint(base)` and `currentEndpoint(base, stationId)` (exported from
`@azohra/meteo/station`) are the only two routes.

## The poller

`createJsonPoller(url, { parse, intervalMsFor, fetchInit?, initial? })`
returns a store: `getSnapshot()` (stable object identity between changes),
`subscribe(listener)`, `start()`, `stop()`, `refresh()`. Its semantics are
owed to every caller identically:

- **Visibility-gated** — a hidden tab skips its ticks and refetches the
  moment it becomes visible; no `document` (SSR, node) counts as visible.
- **In-flight suppression** — a slow response never stacks a second request;
  every request carries an abort deadline (15 s), so a stalled upstream can
  never park the loop.
- **First interval after first response** — the first timer is scheduled
  once the first response settles, so the interval honours the feed's
  advised cadence rather than the pre-data default.
- **Keep-last-on-error** — a failed or unreadable poll keeps the previous
  validated document and flags a structured error:
  `{ kind: "network", status? }` with the HTTP status when a response
  arrived; `{ kind: "contract", cause? }` with the zod error (or JSON syntax
  error) behind an unreadable body.
- **Seeds refresh** — an `initial` snapshot (SSR-fetched data) fills state
  before the first fetch; the first poll still fires, because a seed is a
  starting point, never a substitute for refreshing.
- **The consumer's `fetchInit` rides every request** (headers, credentials,
  cache mode — pass a function to thread the latest values); the loop's own
  abort signal is applied last and wins.
- **A url change is a new poller.** Callers key on the url and construct a
  fresh, seed-less poller, so a held document is never served under a new
  address.

## The stores

- `createStationFeedStore(base, { pollSeconds?, fetchInit?, initial? })` —
  polls `/feed`. Cadence: `pollSeconds`, else the fastest
  `recommendedPollSeconds` any station in the last feed advised, else 60 s.
- `createStationCurrentStore(base, stationId, { pollSeconds?, fetchInit?,
  initial? })` — polls the light `/current` endpoint. Cadence:
  `pollSeconds`, else the station's own `recommendedPollSeconds`, else 15 s
  — this endpoint exists to be quick.
- `createStationStore(base, stationId, options)` — both at once, folded with
  `mergeCurrent` and its **clock rule**: a merged current response advances
  `receivedAtMs` to the current's; a merge that didn't take (station
  unavailable, or absent from the feed) keeps the feed's own clock — never
  credit a dead station with a response it never produced. The feed is the
  backbone: its error outranks the light endpoint's. `refresh()` fans out to
  both.

The fold itself is `foldCurrent(feed, feedReceivedAtMs, current,
currentReceivedAtMs)` on `@azohra/meteo/station`, for callers composing
their own stores.

## Display resolution — shared across bindings

The components' ambient-default discipline is one exported rule,
`resolveDisplay(defaults, props)` on `@azohra/meteo/station`: explicit prop
→ ambient default → package default, for `strings`, `unit` (default
`"kmh"`), `formatTime`, and `thresholds`. Thresholds are a trichotomy, and
the distinction is load-bearing in every binding:

- **omitted** (`undefined`) — inherit the ambient thresholds;
- **a value** — grade against exactly these;
- **`null`** — explicitly opt this component out of ambient grading.

Station resolution for per-station components is `resolveStation(feed,
stationId)`: an explicit `station` always wins, then `stationId` looked up
in the ambient feed, then the feed's `primaryStationId`, then `stations[0]`;
resolving nothing throws a wiring error naming the binding's provider.

## Freshness between polls

Freshness itself is the wire contract's
[model](wire-contract.md#freshness-the-servedat-anchor), computed by
`freshness()` on the root. Between polls every binding re-judges the same
reading every `FRESHNESS_REEVALUATE_MS` (30 s), so a station that dies
visibly ages while the loop keeps returning the last observation. The
hydration rule is shared too: the initial clock is `receivedAtMs` — a value
both a server pass and the client render from — never `Date.now()`, which
differs between the passes; bindings correct to the real clock once mounted.

## Words and formatting

Everything a component prints comes from the isomorphic root, so two
bindings can never disagree on a character: the strings vocabulary
(`defaultStrings`, `resolveStrings`, `mergeStringOverrides`,
`localeFormatTime`), the formatting rules (`roundSpeed`, `optionalSpeed`,
the one-decimal temperature, `updatedAtText`, `summaryEntries`,
`directionCell`), the air sentences (`airSummary`, `lastStrikeWords`,
`airRows`), and the instrument geometry (`DIAL_*`, `ROSE_*`, sparkline
scales — coordinates and path strings, never markup). All on
`@azohra/meteo/station`.

## Stability

Pre-1.0: the poller and store semantics documented here are stable; pin a
minor version if you reach past them.
